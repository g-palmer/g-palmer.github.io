    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>THIS POST IS VERY MUCH STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS</em></strong></p>

<p>When first learning Javascript, aside from simple syntax and some for loops, typically a new developer will jump right into jQuery. This is largely a testament to the simplicity and power of the library as it allows someone with limited programming experience to start doing some pretty nifty things in the browser. jQuery doesn&rsquo;t even shy away from this fact: &lsquo;Write less, Do More&rsquo;. But as overused quotes from that one movie go, <em>&ldquo;With great power, comes great responsibility.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/adv-talk/jquery_logo.png">http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/adv-talk/jquery_logo.png</a>" title="&lsquo;jQuery&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The difference between a beginning developer and an intermediate to advanced developer is their ability to understand where all of this &lsquo;magic&rsquo; is coming from. So what better way to spend the next few minutes than checking out some of the native DOM methods that jQuery is replacing. And in doing so, we can come to better appreciate the library and maybe even speed up some of our sites<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<h3>Selectors</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll begin with the easy stuff. One of the first things people do with jQuery is learn how to select elements(nodes) from the DOM.</p>

<p>In jQuery you simply use a CSS style selector to grab an element of list of elements:</p>

<p><code>javascript
$('div') // returns a list of all matching '&lt;div&gt;' elements
$('#xyz') // returns the matching element with id="xyz"
$('.black') // returns a list of all matching elements with class="black"
</code></p>

<p>But natively we can still do the same thing with:</p>

<p><code>javascript
document.getElementsByTagName('div')
document.getElementById('xyz')
document.getElementsByClassName('black')
</code></p>

<p>We also can use methods that works more similar to jQuery:</p>

<p><code>javascript
document.querySelector([some CSS style selector string]) // returns first matched element
document.querySelectorAll([some CSS style selector string]) // returns list of matched element
</code></p>

<p>Because these methods also work on elements, we can chain them together to find all the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements with <code>class="black"</code> that are children of the element with <code>id="xyz"</code>.</p>

<p><code>javascript
document.getElementById('xyz').getElementsByTagName('div').getElementsByClassName('black')
</code></p>

<h3>Create and append new elements</h3>

<p>As you know, jQuery also allows us to dynamically create new elements(nodes) and then subsequently add them to the DOM.</p>

<p>In jQuery you just write a string of some valid HTML:</p>

<p><code>javascript
var $div = $('&lt;div class="black"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'); // creates a new div element with class="black" and some paragraph text
var $img = $('&lt;img src="picture.jpg" alt="My Picture"&gt;'); // creates a new img element with a src and alt text
</code></p>

<p>Natively we can still do the same thing:</p>

<p>```javascript
var div = document.createElement(&lsquo;div&rsquo;); // create new div element
div.className = &lsquo;black&rsquo;; // give it a class name of &lsquo;black&rsquo;
var paragraph = document.createElement(&lsquo;p&rsquo;); // create new p element
var text = document.createTextNode(&lsquo;Hello World&rsquo;); // create a new text node
paragraph.appendChild(text); // add text node to the new div
div.appendChild(paragraph)</p>

<p>var img = document.createElement(&lsquo;img&rsquo;); // create a new img element
img.src = &lsquo;picture.jpg&rsquo;; // set it&rsquo;s src using direct property manipulation
img.setAttribute(&lsquo;alt&rsquo;, &lsquo;My Picture&rsquo;); // set it&rsquo;s alt using setAttribute method (similar to using img.alt)
<code>``
What I think is cool, and simplifies thinking about things a bit, is we can directly update properties on a node since it is basically just an object. An example of this is setting the</code>src<code>of the img by simply setting this property of the</code>img` node.</p>

<p>This works for just about everything from setting styles (CSS) to classes, ids and any data. Basically log a DOM node to the Chrome console and you can see all of the properties that are accessible.</p>

<p>Typically the next step would be to add these elements to the DOM</p>

<p>```javascript
$(&lsquo;body&rsquo;).append($div) // jQuery select body element and append the new div</p>

<p>document.querySelector(&lsquo;body&rsquo;).appendChild(div) // native select body, then append div
```</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s actually some other ways that we can create elements and add them to the DOM using document and element methods such as <code>createDocumentFragment</code>, <code>innerHTML</code>, and <code>textContent</code>.</p>

<h3>Ajax</h3>

<p>Now for some of the more fun stuff. jQuery makes sending ajax requests incredibly simple:</p>

<p><code>javascript
$.ajax([options])
</code>
Where options is an object containing things like the URL, ajax method, headers, data to send and callback functions.</p>

<p>Natively, things are a bit different, and can easily get complex. A lot of what makes jQuery ajax so nice is it abstracts away a lot of this complexity. To keep things simple, let&rsquo;s just say we want to make a &lsquo;GET&rsquo; request to a RESTful API and we expect to recieve some JSON data back, which we&rsquo;ll log to the console.</p>

<p>We have to create a new instance of the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class<sup>2</sup> to get things started.</p>

<p><code>javascript
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
</code></p>

<p>From there, we&rsquo;ll need to setup the request and make things happen.</p>

<p><code>javascript
request.
</code></p>

<blockquote><p>1 By using native DOM APIs, we don&rsquo;t need to load jQuery (or can conditionally load jQuery if the browser doesn&rsquo;t support native DOM APIs). In addition, many performance tests have shown that using the native methods is quite a bit faster than jQuery. The tradeoff is that jQuery can also perform the methods on older browsers where native DOM APIs aren&rsquo;t supported &mdash; making things easier overall.
2 Read more about the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">MDN</a>. There&rsquo;s a bunch more it can do than just handle XML data and HTTP requests.</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://gpalmer.me/blog/2013/06/22/reading-the-underscore-dot-js-source-code</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that I feel like I&rsquo;ve got a better understanding of the Javascript language, it&rsquo;s always been a side goal of mine to read through as many of the major JS frameworks, libraries, etc. as I can. I feel like being able to read through and understand what others have done to make really awesome code, will help push me along the way to be an even better coder myself.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/images/underscore.png">http://underscorejs.org/docs/images/underscore.png</a>" title="&lsquo;underscore.js&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank"><em>underscore.js</em></a> library has a special place in my heart as it played a major role in the early stages of learning JS. So what better place to start &mdash; here are a few notes from my runthrough of the <em>underscore.js</em> source:</p>

<p><strong>1. Setting the stage</strong></p>

<p>  The first bit of Underscore is all about setting the stage for the rest of the library by creating variables and setting references. This alone is not all that interesting, and something most programmers do. What caught my eye was the few lines meant to save bytes, boost performance and just make things easier later on.</p>

<p>```javascript
var ArrayProto = Array.prototype, ObjProto = Object.prototype, FuncProto = Function.prototype;</p>

<p>var push             = ArrayProto.push,</p>

<pre><code>  slice            = ArrayProto.slice,
  concat           = ArrayProto.concat,
  toString         = ObjProto.toString,
  hasOwnProperty   = ObjProto.hasOwnProperty;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>  The above lines create references to prototype functions and save them to local variables. This only requires the prototype lookup once and never again&mdash;a performance boost, albeit quite marginal, that you can see in this <a href="http://jsperf.com/underscoreprotoperf#run" target="_blank">JSPerf test</a>.</p>

<p>  As noted in the annotations, this also saves a few bytes in the minified version of the library. For example <code>push.call</code> is quite a few characters shorter than <code>Array.prototype.push.call</code>.</p>

<p><strong>2. <code>(obj.length === +obj.length)</code></strong></p>

<p>  What the hell does that mean?</p>

<p>  Turns out, it&rsquo;s not that crazy. It basically just tests if the object&rsquo;s length property is a number. The unary <code>+</code> operator on the right side coerces whatever follows to a number. The <code>===</code> conditional then returns true only if the object&rsquo;s length property was already a number. This basically means that the only things to pass this conditional will be an array, string or a function<sup>1</sup>. Fancy, huh?</p>

<p><strong>3. <code>array.push</code> vs. <code>array[array.length]</code></strong></p>

<p>  In Underscore&rsquo;s annoted source code, the map function uses <code>results[results.length]</code> to push items to the end of an array. Curious about why they chose this implementation, I researched a bit on the differnces between using <code>length</code> instead of the <code>push</code> method. There seems to be quite a bit of discussion around this topic (more than is necessary here), but this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/614126/why-is-array-push-sometimes-faster-than-arrayn-value" target="_blank">Stack Overflow discussion</a> delves into the native C implementation of an array behind the scenes and includes some more JSPerf tests.</p>

<p>  Worth noting is that in the most recent version of the underscore.js source on GitHub, the map function is now using <code>push</code>.</p>

<p><strong>4. Using <code>each</code> to loop backwards</strong></p>

<p>  I always thought of <code>each</code> as a simple looping function that started at the front and worked it&rsquo;s way to the end. It went front to back and nothing more. In Underscore&rsquo;s <code>reduceRight</code> function, they pull a sweet little trick that I had never really thought of before&mdash;looping backwards through a collection using <code>each</code>.</p>

<p>  The trick is to keep a simple counter that begins at the collection&rsquo;s length, and rewrite the index with this counter every time through the <code>each</code> loop before doing anything else. Every time through the loop, simply reduce the counter. Magic!</p>

<p><strong>5. <code>void 0</code> and <code>undefined</code> is mutable</strong></p>

<p>  On line 243 of Underscore, right in the middle of the <code>where</code> function, we are presented with the lovely <code>void 0</code>:</p>

<p>```javascript
<em>.where = function(obj, attrs, first) {
  if (</em>.isEmpty(attrs)) return first ? void 0 : [];
  return _<a href="obj,%20function(value">first ? &lsquo;find&rsquo; : &lsquo;filter&rsquo;</a> {</p>

<pre><code>for (var key in attrs) {
  if (attrs[key] !== value[key]) return false;
}
return true;
</code></pre>

<p>  });
};
<code>``
  What the hell does that mean? Ya, I had no idea either. First time I've ever seen it. Come to find out that the keyword</code>void<code>is a special function that will always return</code>undefined<code>regardless of it's input (and it doesn't even need parens, much like</code>typeof<code>and</code>instanceof`.</p>

<p><code>javascript
void 0 // returns undefined
void(0) // returns undefined
void 98457 // returns undefined
void 'I bet this will be undefined' // returns undefined
</code></p>

<p>  So why not just use <code>undefined</code>? Well apparently <code>undefined</code> is simply a variable belonging to the all seeing &lsquo;global object&rsquo; created at run time. This means, that <em>technically</em> it is mutable, i.e. some JS asshole can change it. Therefore, by using <code>void 0</code> (or <code>void [anything]</code> for that matter)<sup>2</sup>, we can be sure that <code>undefined</code> is always the return.</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s about all I have time for at the moment. But I look forward to digging a little deeper in to the Underscore source and seeing what other JS gems I can find. Stay tuned for part 2.</p>

<blockquote><p>1 Functions have a length property!? This was definitely a surprise to me as well, but they sure as hell do. It&rsquo;s equal to number of arguments the function takes.</p>

<p>2 Although we can use <code>void [anything]</code> to get undefined, it has become common practice to use <code>void 0</code> because of it&rsquo;s simple, straightforward and some guy said so a long time ago and everyone else agreed with him.</p></blockquote>
